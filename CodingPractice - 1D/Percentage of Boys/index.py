# Write a program that reads the percentage of girls in a class and prints the percentage of boys in the class.

percentage_of_girls = input() # Input: 30
percentage_of_girls = int(percentage_of_girls) # Convert input to integer
# percentage_of_girls = 30
# percentage_of_boys = 100 - percentage_of_girls
percentage_of_boys = 100 - percentage_of_girls
print(percentage_of_boys) # Output: 70
